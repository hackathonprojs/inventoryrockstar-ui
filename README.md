# inventoryrockstar-ui

to run the demo: 
> git clone https://github.com/hackathonprojs/inventoryrockstar-ui

> cd inventoryrockstar-ui

> npm install

> node app


go to 
http://localhost:8000/visual-inventory.html

then run the tensorflow-react-cam project.  tensorflow-react-cam project will submit the inventory number to http://localhost:8000/inventoryAmount?newValue={newValue}



in the absence of the tensorflow-react-cam project, we can use the following page to control the inventory amount.
http://localhost:8000/control.html  
when you change the inventory amount, you can see the corresponding changes on visual-inventory.html.


alternatively, this url can be used to change the inventory amount.
http://localhost:8000/inventoryAmount?newValue=3
